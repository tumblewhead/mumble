# mumble

C research reference for battery estimation from a 35 Hz voltage/current stream.

The goal is to **estimate what the available stimulus supports, retain earlier
evidence, and explicitly report what remains unknown**. The longer-term target
is a streaming Cortex-M23 implementation. The original nonlinear fitting path
retains and replays history. A new bounded event component preserves a fixed
local affine likelihood; cold-start learning and historical relinearization
remain open. Neither path is qualified Cortex-M23 firmware.

## Build and run

The C executable needs a C99 compiler, `make` and `libm`. Python is only needed
for the combined test target, orchestration, independent validation and plots.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tumblewhead/mumble.git
cd mumble
make

python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-reference.txt
make test

./build/scm_estimator \
  --data data/cell_a_35hz_s202610240.csv \
  --case cell_a_35hz_s202610240 \
  --modes 3 --method full --sigma 0.001 \
  --starts 3 --max-iter 120 --prefix 31500
```

The example fits the first 900 seconds and prints estimates and uncertainty
qualification as JSON. Sample index is the ordering authority, with an explicit
interval in seconds. Positive current discharges; current is measured in A and
voltage is sampled at the end of each constant-current interval.

Use `--ocv path/to/ocv.csv` for a measured 25 C curve with columns `z,voltage`.
The included benchmark uses a known illustrative curve because the numerical
measured curve was not supplied. It must not be described as real-cell validation.

## Completed 35 Hz study

The main campaign contains two synthetic cells, three noise seeds per cell,
73,500 samples per trace, and ten chronological prefixes: **60 fits**. All
sixteen model quantities, including entering states, are unknown to fitting.
Truth enters independent scoring only.

| Result across six runs | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Current SOC error below 0.5 percentage points | From the 600 s checkpoint onward |
| Capacity error below 0.5% | From the 900 s checkpoint onward |
| Every resistance and RC time constant below 10% point error | By the 220 s checkpoint |
| Worst final current-SOC error | 0.00350642 percentage points |
| Worst final capacity error | 0.0163354% |
| Numerical stopping status | 50 converged; 10 iteration limits |

“From” means the first tested checkpoint passing the threshold at that and every
remaining tested checkpoint. These are stimulus-specific results under a matched
25 C model, exact current/time, known OCV, and independent 1 mV Gaussian noise.
Local precision and truth accuracy are reported separately. Some R0 and fastest
pole estimates remain unresolved despite useful SOC/capacity estimates.

![35 Hz convergence](report/SCM-35Hz-Convergence.png)

The supplemental event-local comparison retains 723 one-anchor features or
1,442 five-anchor features from 73,500 voltage samples, across 106 event blocks.
Both preserve close fits in the two tested traces. Explicit basis storage still
costs megabytes and increases CPU time. Small feature payload is not complete
firmware memory consumption.

The final quiet-window control shows why earlier evidence matters. A complete
history fit retains useful SOC/capacity estimates; a fit to the last weak-use
window alone remains unresolved despite a similar voltage RMSE.

## Reproduce or inspect

Included results can be inspected without repeating optimization. To regenerate
the study, see [README.txt](README.txt). These commands overwrite their named
generated outputs, so use a work branch when making a new campaign:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c experiment/my-next-study
make
make test
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/run_streaming.py --workers 3
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/run_profiles.py --workers 3
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/run_compression.py
MPLCONFIGDIR=/tmp/mumble-mpl python3 tools/make_report.py
git status --short
```

Record the source revision, commands, assumptions and validation before committing
new results. Keep machine-to-machine handoffs compact JSON. Source and evidence
belong in this repository; chat summaries are supporting context.

## Implementation map

- `src/scm_model.c`, `include/scm_model.h`: chronological state propagation and sensitivities.
- `src/scm_features.c`, `include/scm_features.h`: orthogonal projections.
- `src/scm_estimator.c`, `include/scm_estimator.h`: host variable-projection estimator.
- `src/scm_assess.c`, `include/scm_assess.h`: fixed-workspace per-target qualification.
- `src/scm_evidence.c`, `include/scm_evidence.h`: bounded fixed-chart event evidence and guards.
- `src/main.c`: CSV/JSON host CLI.
- `tests/`: model, estimator, projection, constraint and qualification checks.
- `tools/`: data generation, runners, independent scoring and report construction.
- `reference_binaries/`: preserved Linux x86-64 executables for exact study provenance;
  build the source for your own host. These are not MCU images.

## Next work and limits

The current priority is controlled nonlinear validity and bounded chart
initialization/change around the new fixed-chart evidence component.
Subsequent experiments should cover measured OCV, sensor
offsets, filtered/correlated noise, model mismatch and parameter drift. The current
study does not validate aging, temperature variation, EOD prediction, or Cortex-M23
latency, SRAM, flash or power. The requested 35 Hz operating point was tested;
20 Hz and 1 kHz comparisons remain separate work.

## Bounded event prototype

`scm_evidence` consumes each actual interval/current/voltage observation once,
carries model state and sensitivities across events, and merges event-local
augmented QR factors into one aggregate. It retains no sample history or
explicit Q basis. Source/index checks prevent duplicate ingestion in a live
bank. Parameter-radius, physical-domain and residual diagnostics expose
unsupported updates without deleting evidence.

The corrected small experiment preserves the reference's unresolved 400 s
SOC/capacity status, reproduces informative 900 s local precision and carries
earlier information through the final quiet tail. All 72 checks pass. The
nominal-chart control fails: local rank/precision alone cannot qualify a
poorly placed nonlinear model. A separate inside-radius witness shows that
the current radius is not a nonlinear likelihood-error certificate.

On this host, the persistent bank plus update workspace uses 7,512 bytes;
the simultaneous snapshot/diagnostic/solve objects bring that subtotal to
18,408 bytes before additional configuration, input, stack and runtime costs.
The complete approximately 10 KiB subsystem target is not achieved.

```bash
make build/scm_evidence_probe test-evidence evidence-stack
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 python3 tools/run_bounded_event.py \
  --output-dir experiments/bounded_event_001/my_new_receipt
python3 tools/measure_bounded_memory.py \
  --probe-result experiments/bounded_event_001/my_new_receipt/carry_1800_to_2100.json \
  --output experiments/bounded_event_001/my_new_memory.json
```

Both helpers refuse existing outputs. The original 60-fit campaign is not
needed to reproduce this small experiment. Read the
[design and results](docs/BOUNDED_EVENT_001.md) before treating local evidence
as a nonlinear estimate.

The original study release manifest is preserved in
[`provenance/study_release.json`](provenance/study_release.json). The original
import adapted documentation and verification-helper paths. The later bounded
prototype is recorded separately; original study outputs and numerical
reference sources remain preserved.
